Computer scientist with a maker attitude, with a passion for building complex systems that can work in real-life scenarios. I am a professional coder and a PhD in biorobotics with international research experience. Not afraid to get my hands dirty in order to build interesting things.

Like most geeks, I enjoy passing time by reading comics books, playing video games and watching sci-fi movies, but I also dedicate part of my spare time to study more about computer science, customize my prompt and develop pet projects such as programs to automate daily activities, software libraries and games.
