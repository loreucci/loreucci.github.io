## **Education**

<br/>

### PhD in BioRobotics
**The BioRobotics Institute, Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, Pisa, Italy**
<br/>
*October 2014 - June 2018*

Thesis title: *Brain-inspired methods for adaptive and predictive
control of humanoid robots*

Work focused on the development of control strategies that take inspiration from the human brain and that show predictive and adaptive capabilities. This has been achieved
by employing neuro-controllers employing two technologie: machine learning approaches and Spiking Neural Networks.

<br/>

### Visiting PhD Student
**University of Tokyo**
<br/>
*March 2017 - September 2017*

Development of a neuro-musculo-skeletal model for robotic control. The model included a comprehensive spinal cord model, implemented as a spiking neural network and the corresponding musculoskeletal system.

<br/>
